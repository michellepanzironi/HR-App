For this project, we're going to pretend to make part of an HR App!

Please use react. You may use other tools (like redux) if you want.


Your front end will fetch candidates from "the api" at https://randomuser.me/api ✅

It should
- Show a new candidate to the user ✅
- Allow the user to reject or approve a candidate ✅
- Allow the user to "undo" rejecting or approving a candidate ✅
- Allow the user to leave a note when rejecting/approving ✅
- View the list of candidates they've approved/rejected ✅

*extra
	set up tailwind?


Please write automated tests. We prefer jest and the react-testing-library.

Please include a *detailed* readme with *step by step* instructions for installing and running your application.

Please reach out if you have any questions. Don't spend all day on this!
